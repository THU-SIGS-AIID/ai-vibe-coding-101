## Project Introduction

2025 is seen by many as the inaugural year of AI programming. More and more people have started using AI to write code, but what they produce often stays at the toy level. And when it comes to actually getting started, people are often discouraged by various barriers:
- Not knowing which AI programming tools are best for writing code;
- Not knowing how to apply large model capabilities to specific products;
- Not being clear about how far the code written by AI is from being truly ready for production.

Through this project, we hope to help you master the best practices for coding with an AI partner. You will learn to use the power of AI to independently complete games, practical tools, and product prototypes through a series of project-based learning challenges, and finally create a product of your own.

We believe that you alone can become a front-end and back-end developer, an AI algorithm developer, and a product manager.

### Target Audience

This project is primarily intended for learners who want to systematically learn vibe coding and native AI application development, including but not limited to:

- Students in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related or interdisciplinary majors who want to systematically introduce vibe coding and native AI development through practical experience.
- Junior to intermediate developers with basic programming skills who want to learn vibe coding and build native AI applications.
- Open source enthusiasts and independent developers who want to lower the barrier to AI-native development and leverage free resources to create derivative works.
- Corporate technical teams and AI startups aiming to quickly prototype native AI applications.
- Non-developer roles (such as product managers) who want to master basic development tasks and provide technical support for AI initiatives.

### What Will You Gain?

- Understand what vibe coding is and its general practices.
- Master the basic path of designing and implementing native AI applications from zero to one.
- Familiarize yourself with the development of different forms of AI applications such as games, tools, and product prototypes through multiple complete projects.
- Learn and practice key tools and infrastructure such as Git, API, RAG, AI IDE, and Zeabur.
- Master product thinking and learn to build products that meet user needs.
- Form a reusable AI-native product development workflow through practice.

### Roadmap

- [ ] Complete unfinished project extra documentation.
- [ ] Refine and polish content for Project 1 & 2 and Extra 2 based on internal testing feedback.
- [ ] Supplement and push unreleased tutorials, while optimizing the online reading experience.
- [ ] Fix unnatural parts of the English version of the repository.

## Content Navigation

This tutorial divides content into three difficulty levels for learners at different stages:

- **Beginner**: Suitable for AI programming novices, focusing on basic tool usage and simple application experiences.
- **Intermediate**: Suitable for developers with some foundation, involving front-end and back-end interaction, database integration, and multi-modal capabilities.
- **Advanced**: Suitable for advanced learners, covering full-stack development, system architecture design, and complex engineering configurations.

## How to Learn

- It is recommended to have basic programming experience (any language is fine) and an interest in AI and product development.
- Follow the Project modules from 0 to 6 in order, progressing from small games to complete application prototypes.
- Supplement common knowledge such as Git, API, RAG, and deployment in the Extra modules to complete your AI development knowledge map.
- When encountering problems, try to troubleshoot and search on your own first, then compare and reflect with the tutorial and source code.

You can selectively read and practice relevant chapters based on your personal time and needs, but it is recommended to complete at least all Projects to form a complete practical loop.
