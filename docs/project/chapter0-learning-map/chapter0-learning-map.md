# From Ideas to AI Products

We are currently experiencing an explosive wave of AI technology applications driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike in the past, where AI development relied heavily on algorithmic research, the industry's focus has now shifted to effectively leveraging existing powerful AI models to create valuable applications. This shift has significantly lowered the barrier to AI development, moving the focus from "building models from scratch" to "encapsulating AI capabilities into real-world solutions."

For most beginners and developers, the greatest opportunity today lies not in inventing new algorithms, but in learning how to effectively call, orchestrate, and engineer AI functions to meet specific market and user needs.

Despite this shift, many learners find that mastering the skills to interact with AI or generate content is just a starting point. A pervasive challenge remains: how to bridge the gap from "AI user" to "AI application creator." Key questions include: How to integrate scattered AI functions into automated workflows? How to build robust and reliable front-ends and back-ends for AI applications and deploy them online? How to cross the critical "last mile" from development to actual operation?

This course is designed to address these critical obstacles. It does not dwell on abstract theories but is dedicated to end-to-end practical training in AI-native application development.

# Why Learn This? How Will It Help My Future?

This course focuses on the practical development of AI-native applications and the cultivation of innovative thinking, tailored specifically for beginner-level students. Through a combination of theoretical guidance and hands-on practice, students will gradually master the essential core methods and innovative approaches for AI application development:

* **Master the basic application methods and applicable scenarios of multi-modal AI models:**
  * Be able to use vibe coding tools to call mainstream multi-modal understanding and generation model APIs (covering text, image, video, audio, etc.).
  * Be able to analyze the capability boundaries of different models and appropriately select models based on specific application scenarios.
* **Be able to utilize and analyze cutting-edge AI products:**
  * Be able to research and analyze various state-of-the-art AI products in the industry (based on text, image, video), learn to analyze the technical principles behind product construction, and understand common implementation methods used by competitors.
* **Basic understanding and practice of different AI application frameworks and core workflows:**
  * **Knowledge Base & AI Workflow:** Understand the basics of knowledge base construction and develop basic and intermediate skills in using them, as well as the ability to design, implement, and optimize AI workflows.
  * **Agents:** Understand the principles of agents and gain initial practical experience in agent development and application.
  * **Image Generation and Editing:** Master introductory and advanced techniques in image generation and editing workflows.
* **Practical experience in AI-native application development and operation:**
  * Learn to use advanced AI coding tools; understand the roles of front-end and back-end databases; and be able to independently develop and deploy AI applications (APP / Web applications).
  * Understand the implementation methods of core functional modules such as user management and payment.
  * Gain basic skills in user research, product promotion, and application sharing; at the same time, start exploring the value creation closed loop of AI applications through cooperation with enterprises or independent operation.

# Why Use Project-Based Training?

The reason is simple: given the current state of most students, entering the workplace directly would likely lead to difficulties under the pressure of real projects and bosses/clients. A more common scenario in the real world is:

> Your mentor / boss: We need to build xxx, aiming for the effect of yyy.
>
> Documentation? Ready-made frameworks? Detailed requirement specifications? Many times, they don't exist.

Many tasks in real work are essentially solving never-before-seen problems in highly uncertain environments: requirements are vague, boundaries are changing, no one tells you the standard answer, and you need to look up information, do experiments, build prototypes, iterate continuously, and finally provide a "runnable, usable, and deployable" solution.

What this course aims to do is to give you a "simulated real-world experience" in a relatively safe environment:

- Through seemingly challenging project tasks, force you to practice decomposing problems, designing solutions, and finding information on your own.
- Through not-so-"dummy-proof" scaffolding and code, let you learn to read, understand, and transform a medium-to-large codebase.
- Through a complete closed loop from idea to launch, let you experience the full 0 to 1 process of a real product.

In the short term, this training is indeed quite demanding; but in the long term, it will greatly enhance your competitiveness in job seeking and career development: you will be more capable of handling tasks, more able to find breakthroughs in uncertain environments, and more capable of turning AI into truly landed products rather than staying at the "playing with demos" stage.

# I've Been Persistent for a Long Time but Still Can't Get It Done, I Want to Give Up

Maybe the method you're sticking to is wrong. Don't struggle alone in the dark; come and talk to the authors and teaching assistants: honestly state the methods you've tried, the specific sticking points you've encountered, and your current mental state. Many times, just a slight adjustment in direction or filling in a key knowledge point can help you move forward.

# I Think Some Designs of the Tutorial are Unreasonable

Feel free to contact the author, submit an issue, or provide feedback directly in the group or in class. We very much hope to work with you to polish this tutorial and make it better and better: let us know honestly where it's unclear, where the experience is not good, or where it's making you waste effort. The more real and specific the feedback, the more it helps newcomers avoid pitfalls.
